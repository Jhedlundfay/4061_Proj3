Hits from the cache are much faster than misses because we don't have to do any reading from the disk we already have a value loaded in the cache. It is more beneficial to have more threads in order to divide up the work and increase concurrency but there must also be a balance because if there are too many workers there wind up being a lot of threads that are stuck waiting at the critical regions. If the number of threads and number of requests aren't similar there is a lot of unused overhead.
